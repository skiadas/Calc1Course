## Notes

### Higher Derivatives

Since the first derivative is a function itself, we can take *its* derivative. We call this the second derivative:

> **Second Derivative**
> $$\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} = f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(f'(x)\right)$$

Example: Let $f(x) = 3x^3-x^2+1$. Then $f'(x) = 9x^2-2x$. Then the derivative of that is $f''(x) = 18x-2$.

We can similarly take *higher-order derivatives*:

> **Higher Order Derivatives**
> $$f^{(3)}(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(f''(x)\right)$$
> $$f^{(4)}(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(f^{(3)}(x)\right)$$
> and so on.

#### Practice

- Calculate the first four derivatives of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.
- Calculate the first four derivatives of $2x^3-2x^2+x-1$.
- Calculate the first four derivatives of $\sin(x)$.
