## Notes

### The derivative as a function

- If the derivative $f'(a)$ exists for all $a$ in some interval, then we can look at the function $f'(x)$ and study its properties.
- We often do this by computing $\displaystyle \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$.
- Example: Derivative of $f(x) = 2x^2 + x$ is $4x+1$.
- Example 2: Derivative of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$ is $-\frac{2}{x^3}$.
- Alternative notation: $\frac{df}{dx}$, $\frac{dy}{dx}$, $\frac{d}{dx}f$, $\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{x=4}$.
- Power Rule:

    > $$\frac{d}{dx} x^n = x^{n-1}$$
- Prove the power rule using both derivative definitions.
- Linearity rules:

    > $$(f+g)' = f' + g'$$
    > $$(kf)' = k f'$$
- Comparing the graph of the derivative with that of the function: The value of the derivative at a point relates to the slope of the tangent of the function at that point. Look for whether the slope increases/decreases.
- When is the tangent line horizontal?
- Differentiability requires continuity:

    > If $f$ is differentiable at $x=a$, then $f$ is also continuous at $a$.
    >
    > Alternatively, if $f$ is not continuous at $a$ then it cannot possibly be differentiable there.
- There are functions that are continuous but not differentiable (e.g. $|x|$).
