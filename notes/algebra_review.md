# Algebra Review

## Reading

- Review the algebra cheatsheet at the front of the book.
- Read sections 1.1, 1.2

## Practice problems

- Section 1.1: 11, 15, 17, 23
- Section 1.2: 11, 13, 15, 22, 25, 35, 37

## Notes

### Algebra

- Multiplication distributes over addition
- Identities for $(x\pm y)^2$, $x^2-y^2$, $x^3\pm y^3$
    - Question: Simplify $(x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2$
    - Conclusion: If a integer is the sum of two squares, then so is its double
    - What about $(x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2$?
    - Conclusion: The product of two even numbers is a difference of squares
- Multiplicative inverses
- Division is multiplication by the inverse
    - $\frac{a}{b} = a\cdot{1}{b}$
    - $\frac{c}{b/a} = \frac{ac}{b}$
- Solving a linear equation such as $5x+3 = 6x - 1$
- Find the error in proof that $0 = 1$
- Solving an equation such as $(x-2)(x+1)(x-3)=0$
- Linear functions and linear equations
    - Rise-over-run interpretation
    - Slope-intersect, point-slope, point-point forms
    - Does this describe all lines in the plane?
- Solving a quadratic equation such as $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$
    - Quadratic formula and completing the square
    - Graph of quadratic

### Inequalities

- Trichotomy:
    - For any two numbers $a, b$, either $a<b$ or $a=b$ or $a>b$
    - Every number is either positive, zero, or negative
- Inequalities and addition
- Inequalities and multiplication (when does the direction reverse?)
- Absolute value
- Triangle inequality
- Various interpretations of the inequality $|x-a| < r$
- Question: If $|x-1| < 2$, then:
    - Is it true that $|x-1| < 1$?
    - Is it true that $|x-1| < 3$?
    - Is it true that $x > -3$?
    - Is it true that $x > 0$?
